      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>
        I am a positive, driven and enthusiastic person. I love testing and building software. I enjoy learning about new methodologies, test heuristics, tools and libraries that I can try out and see how I can then incorporate them into my day to day role. I Have given talks on BDD and automation. The Introduction to BDD talk was at the North East Testaltelier. The introduction to writing UI automation talk, I presented at the north east agile tester, Newcastle MOT meetup and at a Leeds testing Meetup. Over the course of my career I have ran numerous workshops for teams across Sage and SolarWinds/N-able. I have helped development teams at Sage and Solarwinds/N-able become more integrated and helped them implement agile principles and practices (specifically BDD) to improve their teamwork and also the quality of their releases. I have a half day workshop which I created and have used to teach engineers and stakeholders about the benefits of more integrated working practices.

    <div class="talent-container">
      <div class="talent">
        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>Competent and confident in my ability to manage the full testing lifecycle of a product, from static analysis of requirements at the start, in step automation checks using the principles of BDD to guide their creation, then to manual testing and issue track and finally through to deployment and post deployment sanity testing. I have written and maintained multiple automation frameworks from scratch using a variety of tools and languages and enjoy sharing this knowledge whenever possible.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="talent">
        <h2>Software Development</h2>
        <p>I am most at home when writing C#, I have built microservices using asp.net, along with maintaining them and adding new features to them over time. I have experience in writing and maintaining CI/CD pipelines and deploying services through to production via those pipelines. I have dabbled in app creation and have recently started to learn front end development using angular too. I am happy to turn my hand to anything and believe that writing the code is one small part of building great software.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="talent">
        <h2>Project Management</h2>
        <p>I have a lot of experience as a scrum master, I have a great wealth of experience with taking requirements from Product management, converting those requirements into backlog items and then organise and present that backlog to teams, working with teams to then refine those tickets, and then develop and test those tickets all the way through to them being delivered to production. I prefer to use parts of the SAFe namely PI planning as a means to scope and refine deliverables and am a fan of example mapping as a means to break down requirements and tickets.</p>

          <h3>Staff Automation/QE(Technical Test Lead)</h3>
          <h4>June 2022 - Present</h4>
          <p>I am currently the technical test lead for the apple focused products here are N-able, I am responsible for giving guidance and providing coaching to the engineers across the department. For example, I recently helped a tester setup playwright for testing the UI she worked on and facilitated a meeting with the development team to talk to them about a test harness and test data for their UI to aid the implementation of the UI automation suite. Then a couple of weeks later did a POC using K6 for load testing and then set up  the foundation for updating a core team's load testing suite away from JMeter (which I set up in 2019) to use K6 instead and have so far implemented scripts for around a dozen API endpoints. I also maintain the API and UI automation for the Device manager for Apple team. The API suite is written in ASP .Net(C#) and uses Nunit and Refit, the pipeline that runs in AzureDevOps, whereas the UI automation uses playwright and is written in typescript. On top of the technical leadership I still offer and deliver BDD training to new starters and believe that cross-skilled and collaborative teams have become a normal part of the culture in our department now.</p>

          <h4>April 2021 - June 2022</h4>
          <p>I was a senior developer working on the backend for a product called device manager for apple, which is an MDM based product specialising in managing apple devices. The backend is a microservice and is  event driven, built on ASP .NET, hosted on AWS, deployed using Azure Devops pipelines and releases. We use Nunit for our unit testing. We have put a lot of effort into keeping the code as clean as possible and using consistent patterns like the mediator pattern and the repository pattern which enables us to still quickly add new features even as the code base grows and ages.</p>

          <h4>October 2020 - April 2021</h4>
          <p>As a product owner of the Device Management for Apple (DMA) teams. I run daily refinements and the Program Increment planning with the teams. I am also responsible for reporting progress of the projects and increments to the wider business. While doing this I also develop some features for the ADM backend service which is ASP.Net, I help maintain and build the pipelines which are in azure dev ops and deploy docker images of our microservices to AWS (we use ECR and EKS). We take a TDD approach with development which I am a big fan of although I sometimes find it difficult. I am also currently coaching a tester on the ADM team to write automation for the front end UI that is written in Typescript and uses protractor with Jasmine as the framework. I also help test the services after they are deployed using postman although I intend to automate this using an ASP.Net project and integrate it into the build pipeline, when I find the time.</p>

          <h2>Solarwinds MSP</h2>
          <h3>Senior Test Engineer & SCRUM Master</h3>
          <h4>February 2017 - October 2020</h4>
          <p>I worked as a tester on the mobile team. At that time, I specialized in Xamarin.UITest and was responsible for automating our applications. I had built a test framework and test suite from the ground up because when I started, they were still using Calabash. While automation was a significant part of my job, I was also responsible for manually testing the applications and had to ensure we struck the right balance between automation and manual testing. I also held the role of BDD Champion for Solarwinds UK Engineering. In this capacity, I ran training sessions for every member of the UK Engineering team, explaining what BDD was and how to integrate it into the SDLC. Following this, I conducted workshops for all the SCRUM teams to assist them in implementing BDD into their processes. Additionally, I served as the SCRUM Master for the mobile team since May 2018, which I enjoyed as Agile was something I believed in, and SCRUM was a practice in which I had extensive experience and was continually seeking to improve my knowledge.</p>
          <p><b>Main duties/skills gained:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>I undertook development work (ASP .NET) when there was little to no testing work. This included writing unit tests (Nunit).</li>
            <li>I also fixed the bugs that I found while testing, although it was by choice and not out of necessity. I performed code reviews for the developers and helped identify potential bugs that could arise from the static analysis of their code.</li>
            <li>A significant portion of my time was dedicated to writing UI automation using Protractor.</li>
            <li>I solidified some beliefs and learned more about BDD.</li>
            <li>I gained more exposure to public speaking and improved my presentation skills.</li>
            <li>I acquired a deeper understanding of the responsibilities of a SCRUM master and what that entailed at Solarwinds.</li>
            <li>I learned various methods to promote communication within a team.</li>
